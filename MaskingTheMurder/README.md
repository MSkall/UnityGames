# Masking the Murder

Masking the Murder is a first person rhythm action game where you need to track down your old colleague amidst a high class dinner party and take their life.

Setting: The setting is a grand dance hall/room where your target is hidden from you. Guards are patrolling the surrounding area and are on the lookout for anyone suspicious.

Main premise of the game: The goal is to remain hidden from your target so they do not suspect you and run away before you can eliminate them. All of your actions and interactions with objects in the world, however, have to be executed to the beat of the music. That is, shooting and dancing with other characters has to be on time with the beat, otherwise your suspicion drops drastically and you risk being kicked out of the dance hall.

This project's contributors include myself and my partner Michael Perce. It is a semester-long project for CTIN 484/489, which we work with a partner to create a game, gaining the skills and experiences of working with others, learning to communicate ideas clearly, and meeting deadlines.
