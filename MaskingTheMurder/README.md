# Masking the Murder

Masking the Murder is a first person rhythm action game where you need to track down your old colleague amidst a high class dinner party and take their life.

This project's contributors include myself and my partner Michael Perce. It is a semester-long project for CTIN 484/489, which we work with a partner to create a game, gaining the skills and experiences of working with others, learning to communicate ideas clearly, and meeting deadlines.
